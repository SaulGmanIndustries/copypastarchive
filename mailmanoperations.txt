[RADIO] S17:ODL.BLADE-1: Sorry CA, I did not mean to interrupt your mailman operations, obviously you know better than I do. Your job sitting at your desk using your coloring book is far more important than me ripping the faces off of Anti-Citizens with the AR-2. Hopefully I didn't hurt your little ears and you can still do your job reading letters from little boys and girls who would have you dead in a heartbeat. Just know, if they come knocking, don't expect me to save you when the time comes. I find it very hard to believe that you would have the audacity to not only disrespect myself and the Overwatch Battalion as a whole, but the integrity of the entire Combine. Tread lightly you imbecile.
