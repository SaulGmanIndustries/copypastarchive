At first this server seemed like a nice balance of RP and fun, but now it has become nothing more than a regular CVR. I would like to congratulate the creators for screwing up this server by changing the map to this crap and I hope it's not too late to fix it. The number of players means nothing when the people playing on the server are stupid as hell, so that's not an excuse to leave this map and continue working solely on PVP. The moderators also need to start doing their job because so far it doesn't look good with how many weirdos are still playing on this server, breaking the rules left and right and spoiling the gameplay for decent players. Wake up and realize that the CVR niche is already filled and there are few RP servers. Fix the server please.
