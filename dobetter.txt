[CCA Radio] C17:SqL.VICTOR-7: That was possibly the worst display of teamwork I've ever seen. Not only did you have a lack of general comprehension, a lack of survival skills, and a lack of awareness. You all seriously could not have communicated any worse than I've ever seen. I genuinely don't understand how you could have been trained, been promoted, yet still failed to understand basic team work skills. Do better.
