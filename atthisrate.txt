[OOC] Alex: At this rate im just going to quit this server, dude. All Combines are powerhungry as fuck, and the admins are slow as fuck to take F3s. Also, they pick the worst I17 edit there is. Nerf the fuck out of the Mosin. Make an OWS whitelist, practicing making OTA just a storm with a pulse SMG. I play this server for combat; I don't come here to RP. If I wanted to RP, I would go to Willards or Synapse.
